# Introduction:
A 3D human-robot interaction Gazebo simulator for our paper ["DRL-VO: Learning to Navigate Through Crowded Dynamic Scenes Using Velocity Obstacles"](
https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2023.3257549
)([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.06512.pdf)) in IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO) 2023, and ["Towards Safe Navigation Through Crowded Dynamic Environments"](
https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636102
) in IROS 2021, which is modified from https://github.com/srl-freiburg/pedsim_ros.
The aim of the simulator is to provide a close-to-real-world simulated environment for mobile robots navigating around pedestrians. 
Detailed usage can be found at our [DRL-VO control policy](https://github.com/TempleRAIL/drl_vo_nav.git).

Here is a GIF showing how this simulator works:

## Modifications:
This simulator is based on the Gazebo simulator and PEDSIM library, which uses the social forces model to guide the motion of individual pedestrians. The main modifications from https://github.com/srl-freiburg/pedsim_ros are as follows:
* Integrate Pedsim_ros with the 3D gazebo simulator and turtlebot2 robot;
* Add an additional social force to the robot and other pedestrians;
* Add different test scenarios for robot navigation;
* Change the meshes of spawned agents in the gazebo to make them look like real humans;
